        Aurora's journey began with a lifelong passion for building and a dream to share her love for LEGO with the world. It all started in her humble workshop, where she spent countless hours crafting intricate designs and bringing her imagination to reality, one brick at a time.
        But Aurora's path to success wasn't always smooth. Like many aspiring entrepreneurs, she faced her fair share of challenges along the way. In the early days, she struggled to find her place in the competitive world of online retail.
